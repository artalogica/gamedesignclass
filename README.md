### Inspiration: 
The story behind this game was a Modern AU of the story of Chang'e and Houyi. 

---
*Wikipedia Summary*: 
<br> 
According to legend, Chang'e and her husband Houyi were immortals living in heaven. One day, the ten sons of the Jade Emperor transformed into ten suns, causing the earth to scorch. Having failed to order his sons to stop ruining the earth, the Jade Emperor summoned Houyi for help. Houyi, using his legendary archery skills, shot down nine of the sons, but spared one son to be the sun. The Jade Emperor was obviously not pleased with Houyi's solution to save the earth: nine of his sons were dead. As punishment, the Jade Emperor banished Houyi and Chang'e to live as mere mortals on earth.

Seeing that Chang'e felt extremely miserable over her loss of immortality, Houyi decided to journey on a long, perilous quest to find the pill of immortality so that the couple could be immortals again. At the end of his quest he met the Queen Mother of the West who agreed to give him the pill, but warned him that each person would only need half the pill to become immortal.

Houyi brought the pill home and stored it in a case. He warned Chang'e not to open the case and then left home for a while. Like Pandora in Greek mythology, Chang'e became too curious: she opened up the case and found the pill just as Houyi was returning home. Nervous that Houyi would catch her discovering the contents of the case, she accidentally swallowed the entire pill. She started to float into the sky because of the overdose. Although Houyi wanted to shoot her down in order to prevent her from floating further, he could not bear to aim the arrow at her. Chang'e kept on floating until she landed on the moon.

While she became lonely on the moon without her husband, she did have company. A jade rabbit, who manufactured elixirs, as well as the woodcutter Wu Gang, also lived on the moon.

Other versions of this story tell Chang'e as trying to protect the pill from a theif that broke into their house while Houyi was away, and she swallowed it as to not let the theif get it. 
I wanted to take this moral dilemma/curiousity idea and have a modern take on it. The "immortal pill"/choice in this case is college. In the story modern Chang'e will have to choose between going to the same college as her current bf (Houyi) or her dream school, although not really the same as an immortal pill, captures the idea of choosing between the people you love and (possibly) unfamiliar dreams.

## Coding Process: 
- Scene set up 
- camera movement 
	- tried to set up some camera following mouse movement (didn't work at first) ended up using some low sensitivity rotation 
- dialogue set up 
	- code to move the text forward with click 
- camera movement (again)
	- downloaded Cinemachine (in order to move camera views)
	- followed cinemachine tutorial to get camera working (kind of)
- added audio 
- clicking allowed/not allowed 
- fading/scene changes

## Rules of Game Design: 
1. Mechanics - the mechanics are the point and click in the game, the dialogue & choice options (although there are no choices right now), and the camera movement to see other parts of the scene 
2. Goals - the goal is to complete the game, and make your final decision on whether or not you will stick with what you know or choose to go to the dream school. 
3. Rules - you are limited to the screen and your options. 
4. Components - art, music, colliders 
5. Narrative/Theme - inspiration section 
6. Obstacles - your decision
